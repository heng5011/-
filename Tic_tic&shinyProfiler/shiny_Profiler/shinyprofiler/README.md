# What is Shiny?

Shiny is a lightning fast, fully documented and by far the-easiest-to-use-ever C/C++/Lua high-performance profiler with no extensive surgery for your existing projects. Results are smoothed and shown in run-time as a call-tree or sorted-by-time. Output is also renderable as graphs in Ogre3D and easily customized to any other graphics engine!

> shiny是一个快速的，完整的文档，并且是迄今为止最容易使用的C/ c++ /Lua高性能分析器，不需要对您现有的项目进行大量的操作。结果将被平滑处理，并在运行时显示为调用树或按时间排序。输出也可以以图形的形式呈现在Orge3D中，并且可以很容易地定制为任何其他格式

* Very very low overhead, extremely powerful and accurate high speed profiling 低开销，高速成形
* Amazingly simple-to-use & flexible interface with lots of examples and docs 令人惊讶的简单使用和灵活的界面与大量的例子和文档
* Results are elegantly shown as call-graph or sorted-by-time and readable in run-time code 结果以调用图或按时间排序的形式优雅地显示，并且在运行时代码中可读
* On-the-fly smoothing averages for scientific or main-loop projects like game engines 即时平滑科学或主循环项目(如游戏引擎)的平均值
* Rendering history graphs & nicely colored output in OGRE 3D or your custom engine 在OGRE 3D或您的自定义引擎中渲染历史图形和漂亮的彩色输出
* Clean platform-independent, object-oriented and free-for-any-purpose source code 干净的独立于平台、面向对象和任意用途的源代码
